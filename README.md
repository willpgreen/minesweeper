# Minesweeper

A classic, and the first computer game I can remember playing. I wanted to test my JavaScript skills and implement my first game. I could think of no better choice than the first one I ever played.

## The Game

Minesweeper dates back to the 1960's. The goal of the game is to clear a grid containing hidden mines, using the numbers in neighboring cells as clues. If you hit a mine, game over. You can check out the history of the game [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)).

#### Gameplay
1. Choose your level
   - Beginner: 10x10 grid, 10 mines
   - Intermediate: 16x16 grid, 40 mines
   - Expert: 16x30 grid, 99 mines
   
2. Click any where on the board and the timer will start. The numbers represents how many mines are touching the revealed cell (the count includes diagonals).

3. Right click to place a flag on a suspected mine. Right click again to remove the flag.

4. Keep clicking until only the mines are left. Hit a mine, and you lose. But it's ok, just click the little face at the top and try again.
