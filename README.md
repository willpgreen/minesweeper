# Minesweeper

A classic, and the first computer game I can remember playing. I wanted to test my JavaScript skills and implement my first game. I could think of no better choice than the first one I ever played.

## The Game

Minesweeper dates back to the 1960's. The goal of the game is to clear a grid containing hidden mines, using the numbers in neighboring cells as clues. If you hit a mine, game over.
